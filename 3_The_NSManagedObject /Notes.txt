SECTION 3: SAVING, SEARCHING AND FILTERING

3.11 THE NSMANAGEDOBJECT
Managed Objects are a great way to interact with your data model.
Managed Objects are the object version of your data model.
A managed object has the attributes of the datamodel as properties, and the relationships accessible by a function.
The Managed Object is created as soon as you make your data model (this didn't use to be the case). If you want to give your class some custom behavior you can look at 'Codegen' under utilities inspector and change it to Manual/None. The default is 'Class Definition'.
You can see that the class is created automatically, because the XCode will autocomplete when you instantiate it with the Entity name:


3.12 CREATING AND SAVING MANGED OBJECTS

let notebookObject = Notebook(context: persistentContainer.viewContext)

...and then you can easily access the attributes etc using dot syntax
notebookObject.title = "My Evil Deeds"


3.13 FETCHING DATA

returnObjectsAsFaults - if 'true' this will increase the speed of your fetch request, but the trade off is that you cannot access all of the objects properties.

3.14 SORTING OBJECTS WITH NSSORTDESCRIPTOR
This provides ordering of your fetch results. For example, maybe you want your results in alphabetical order of title.

You can instantiate a sort descriptor with a key that is a string which matches one of the attributes of your entity, and then a bool that indicates whether the order is ascending or descending. Then you need to add the sortdescriptor to the fetchRequest. Note that the fetch request takes in an array of sortdescriptors.

3.15 PREDICATES
Your fetch request can only take one predicate (unlike the array of sort descriptors) However, we will see that predicates can be extremely specific. Here is the syntax for a basic predicate.

let notebookPredicate = NSPredicate(format: "title CONTAINS 'Evil'")
        notebookRequest.predicate = notebookPredicate

Notice that predicates are is case-sensitive, so 'evil' would not return any results...

CONTAINS = exact string contained in the value (case-sensitive)
CONTAINT[c] = same as above but not case-sensitive
