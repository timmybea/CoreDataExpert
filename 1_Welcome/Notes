1.3 HOW TO WORK WITH DATA

A database is an organised collection of data. The more complex your data set, the more useful a database becomes.
A database is essentially a collection of tables (see 1.3.1). Using ids you can make the different tables relational. This reduces redundancy and increases organization.

SQL Query Statement Example:

SELECT * FROM Book WHERE price > 25.00 ORDER BY title (see 1.3.2)

This means we are:
querying the Book table
looking for all books over the price of $25
Ordering the results in alphabetical order of title
